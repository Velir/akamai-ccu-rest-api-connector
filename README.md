# Velir Akamai CCU REST connector for AEM (CQ)

## Description

This bundle provides a "ready to use" OSGI connector for the Akamai Open CCU V3 REST API. This connector has been written in groovy using the http-builder framework.
It is designed to enable cache invalidation for AEM/CQ CMS when assets get invalidated. It can be easily configured with your own credentials
and settings. The connector provides all services that you can request via the REST API as well as convinence 

The bundle is made to be as light as possible and can be installed just by itself. You will need groovy-all version 2.4.7 to be installed along with some others bundles like
httpclient, commons-collections, commons-lang ... but they usually are already there.

As of version 2.5, this bundle requires AEM 6.3+

## Implementation

There are three major classes that manage the invalidation :

- CcuManager is the interface of the connector itself that manages a pool of connections to request the Akamai CCU REST services. It offers a simple method's signature with predefined default values
to invalidate cached objects. You can invalidate by CP code or ARL depending on your strategy. This class doesn't do any processing on the urls that you pass to it. It just makes
sure that the list contains only unique values and adds them to the invalidate caching request.

```groovy
def response = ccuManager.fastPurgeByUrls(["http://www.mysite.com/test", "http://www.mysite.com/test2"])
response = ccuManager.fastPurgeByCpCode("CPCODE1")
response = ccuManager.fastPurge(["http://www.mysite.com/test", "http://www.mysite.com/test2"], PurgeType.ARL, PurgeAction.REMOVE, PurgeDomain.PRODUCTION)
response = ccuManager.fastPurgeByTags(['tag1', 'tag2'])
response = ccuManager.fastPurge(["http://www.mysite.com/test", "http://www.mysite.com/test2"], FastPurgeType.URL, PurgeAction.INVALIDATE, PurgeDomain.STAGING)
response = ccuManager.fastPurge(["http://www.mysite.com/test", "http://www.mysite.com/test2"], FastPurgeType.URL)
response = ccuManager.fastPurge(["CPCODE1"], FastPurgeType.CPCODE)
response = ccuManager.fastPurge(["tag1"], FastPurgeType.TAG)
```

The minimum configuration needed for that service are your Akamai API tokens and secret.

- AkamaiEventHandler is an event handler that listens to com/day/cq/replication by default and just adds a job to a dedicated queue ("com/velir/aem/akamai/ccu/impl/FlushAkamaiItemsJob")
if the path to invalidate begins with one of the values specified in the list "pathsHandled" (By default it is /content/dam).

- FlushAkamaiItemsJob is the job that listens to the queue "com/velir/aem/akamai/ccu/impl/FlushAkamaiItemsJob" and calls the CCuManager.purgeByUrls(...) with the list of paths to
invalidate. These paths are prepended by the rootUrl that represent the scheme + the domain without / at the end.
ex: rootSiteUrl = "http://www.velir.com" and url = "/test" => The path to invalidate will be "http://www.velir.com/test"

You don't have to use the whole thing -- you could easily just use the CCuManager to invalidate your cache without using the listener.

## Configuration

Each of these classes can be configured to fit you need and your Akamai credentials. In your JCR repository under /apps/your_app/config.author/ you can add the following configuration files:

- CcuManagerImpl: *com.velir.aem.akamai.ccu.impl.CcuManagerImpl.xml*

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<jcr:root xmlns:sling="http://sling.apache.org/jcr/sling/1.0" xmlns:jcr="http://www.jcp.org/jcr/1.0"
    jcr:primaryType="sling:OsgiConfig"
    rootCcuUrl="https://api.ccu.akamai.com"
	clientToken="your_clientSecret"
	clientSecret="your_clientSecret"
	accessToken="your_accessToken"
	defaultPurgeAction="remove"
	defaultPurgeDomain="production"
	threadPoolSize="5"/>
```
For more info on credentials see https://developer.akamai.com/introduction/Prov_Creds.html

defaultPurgeAction : The default purge if not specified.
    - remove: (default) Remove the asset from the edge server and force the next request to the asset to reach the origin.
    - invalidate: Just invalidate the asset so the next query will still reach origin but can also still serve the stale value if origin is down.

defaultPurgeDomain : The default domain if not specified.
    - production: (default)
    - staging:
    
threadPoolSize : Number of threads to dedicate to the API HTTP Client. Defaults to 5.

- AkamaiEventHandler: *com.velir.aem.akamai.ccu.impl.AkamaiEventHandler.xml*

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<jcr:root xmlns:sling="http://sling.apache.org/jcr/sling/1.0" xmlns:jcr="http://www.jcp.org/jcr/1.0"
    jcr:primaryType="sling:OsgiConfig"
	pathsHandled="[/content/dam]"/>
```

pathsHandled: Comma separated list of paths that can be invalidated.

- FlushAkamaiItemsJob: com.velir.aem.akamai.ccu.impl.FlushAkamaiItemsJob.xml

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<jcr:root xmlns:sling="http://sling.apache.org/jcr/sling/1.0" xmlns:jcr="http://www.jcp.org/jcr/1.0"
    jcr:primaryType="sling:OsgiConfig"
    rootSiteUrl="http://www.mysite.com"/>
```

rootSiteUrl: The root site url that is prepended to the path being invalidated.
